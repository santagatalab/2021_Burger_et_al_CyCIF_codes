# 2021_Burger_et_al_CyCIF_codes
The repository contains codes for the image and data analysis for the t-CyCIF datasets in Burger et al. Cell 2021

The paper contains two datasets:
1) a KP LucOS mouse model +/- vaccination experiment
2) a cohort of human lung adenocarcinomas

The analysis codes are divided into:
- IMAGE ANALYSIS, which wtart with input the stitched and registered whole slide tissues (obtained using ASHLAR https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.20.440625) and obtains in output single cells matrices
- DATA ANALYSIS, which take in input the single cell matrices generated by the image analysis codes and performs aggregation, filtering and normalization of single cell data. The data analysis folder also contains codes to plot the data, used to generate the plots in the article.

In both sections the codes starting the "RUN_" are stand-alone codes. Other are functions called by the RUN codes. 
Further information about the IMAGE ANALYSIS is provided in the IMAGE ANALYSIS\RUN_ALL.m code.
